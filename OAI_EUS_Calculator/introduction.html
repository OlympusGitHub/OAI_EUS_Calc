			<div id="content">
				<p>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is widely available in academic facilities, but not well established in the community hospital setting. While the initial cost of capital equipment and reimbursement concerns have been a deterrent for community hospitals considering an EUS program, it is important to note that the financial benefits of EUS extend beyond the GI department alone. The EUS program can often be a powerful downstream revenue generator for a hospital, with the EUS case often serving as the patient's first point of entry into the hospital system. A significant percentage of EUS patients may require additional services from the facility, creating an indirect revenue stream that originated within the GI department but benefits the facility as a whole.</p>
				<p class="subsection">About EUS</p>
				<p>EUS combines endoscopy and ultrasound in order to obtain the most accurate, high-resolution images and information about the digestive tract and the surrounding tissue and organs. By guiding an endoscope with an ultrasound transducer at its tip, sound beyond the range of human hearing is emitted within body cavities and creates images of the targeted areas.</p>
				<p>EUS allows a minimally invasive, non-surgical evaluation of the internal organs with a high degree of accuracy. The applications for EUS have continued to expand and are now used to assess several types of cancers and disorders:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Submucosal lesions -- Ultrasound scanning over submucosal nodules in the esophagus or stomach.</li>
						<li>Chronic pancreatitis --  EUS aids in providing detailed information about the pancreas and pancreatic duct.</li>
						<li>Disorders of the bile duct and fecal incontinence.</li>
						<li>Staging of lung cancer -- EUS is valuable in helping physicians detect cancer in mediastinal lymph nodes.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="subsection">What's New</p>
				<p>The GF-UCT180 features a newly developed curved linear array transducer to deliver higher-quality ultrasound image with greater depth and offers you the power and flexibility you need for straightforward tissue sampling to sophisticated endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatment. A redesigned elevator gives you more reliable control over devices passed through the channel and a detachable ultrasound cable helps facilitate easier handling, reprocessing and storage. The endoscopic image the GF-UCT180 incorporates a high-resolution "Q" CCD that delivers sharp, clear images. Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) capability is also supported by the Olympus GF-UCT-180, offering enhanced visualization of mucosal and capillary structures.</p>
